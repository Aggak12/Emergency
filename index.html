          <h3>Looks like they've taken over</h3>
          <p>The Soviet Dolls have gained more trust from the public than the government currently has</p>
          <div class="news__full" hidden>
            <p>
              The Dolls, who were once feared, have now gained much support and respect from the public. They have really proved themselves this past year. Raising the standards in the society, with imported premium vodka, which is now the highest
              selling vodka on the Danish market. <br />
              The demand is high for their quality products. With their elegance and glamour, they have also inspired many women to tap into their elegance and raise their standards. Faux fur and leather is now heavily frowned upon. The Dolls somehow
              have a big influence and are heavily glamourized, so they basically control what is considered chic and fashionable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone thought they were dangerous spies at first, looking to overthrow the Danish government, but that's simply not true. They are just here for corrections, it's not their fault that they accidentally get the public's support while
              at it.
            </p>
            <p>Governments certainly scrutinize them. It is still under investigation if they might be some sort of mafia.. But who cares? Certainly not the public, with all these new improvements.</p>

          <h3>Wives are satisfied with Husband Correction Camps</h3>
          <p>Disappointing husbands are being removed, retrained, and returned — and the numbers speak for themselves.</p>
          <div class="news__full" hidden>
            <p>
              The Soviet Dolls’ Husband Correction Camps continue to expand following a year of what they describe as “direct intervention.” The process is simple. Underperforming husbands are captured either: <br />
              By the Dolls in the wild <br />
              Or through voluntary submission by their spouses via the Dolls’ official website <br />
              Once selected, participants are transported to structured correction facilities, where they undergo intensive behavioral adjustment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Training includes: <br />
              - Listening without interrupting <br />
              - Completing tasks without being asked <br />
              - Understanding emotional needs <br />
              - Basic planning skills <br />
              - Advanced apology technique <br />
              - Attentiveness
            </p>
            <p>
              According to internal tracking, households report: <br />
              64% drop in repeated arguments <br />
              72% increase in shared domestic workload <br />
              58% reduction in stressed out wives <br />
              Significant rise in unsolicited responsibility <br />All participants are returned home following evaluation. Despite early concern from government officials, no long-term detentions have been reported. Most husbands complete the
              program within a structured correction cycle.

          <h3>Creators of VELVET dating app</h3>
          <p>The Soviet Dolls’ compatibility ranking system reshapes modern dating by eliminating imbalance and guesswork.</p>
          <div class="news__full" hidden>
            <p>
              The Soviet Dolls have officially entered the dating market with VELVET, a platform built on one simple idea: <br />
              You date at your level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional apps that rely mostly on photos and random swipes, VELVET evaluates the entire profile. The Dolls scan and review: <br />
              - Photos <br />- Hobbies & interests <br />- Carreer path <br />- Financial status <br />- Communication style <br />- Core values <br />
              Each user is assigned a tier. You can only see and match with people in your tier. No exceptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The system removes what the Dolls call “fantasy matching” — the common frustration of chasing profiles far outside one’s actual effort or compatibility level. Users who improve their profiles — clearer intentions, better photos,
              stronger initiative — can request reevaluation. Promotions are possible. However, according to insiders, the Dolls’ “no-BS meter” is highly calibrated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early analytics show the platform is now one of the fastest-growing dating apps in Denmark. Internal surveys report: <br />
              - Higher match satisfaction <br />
              - Fewer ghosting complaints <br />
              - Lower mismatch rates <br />
              - Increased profile effort across all tiers <br />
              While some users admit that receiving a lower rank can be uncomfortable, many say it acts as motivation. <br />One user shared: <br />
              “At first I was offended. Then I rewrote my profile, updated my photos, and actually put effort in. I got promoted two tiers. It worked.”
